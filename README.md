# breakAIdetection
Experimental script to bypass LLM detection models like zeroGpt, GptZero, copyleaks, and turnItin. The purpose of this script is not to enable cheating but to showcase vulnerabilities in current AI detection tools (August 2024).

# IMPORTANT
Please don't use this to cheat. Tools like TurnItIn indicate that they cannot read files this script has parsed. However, this can still be bypassed by putting in real spaces and thus increasing the word count.
